    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
       In this final, we will investigate the generation and visualization of fractals using three different computational techniques: the Chaos Game, L-Systems, and Hilbery Curves. Each method will demonstrate how complex and self-similar structures can emerge from simple iterative processes or recursive rules. Through the use of Python programming and visualization libraries, we will explore the mathematical principles behind fractals such as the Sierpinski Triangle, Barnsley Fern, fractal trees, and space-filling curves. This final will emphasize the power of deterministic and probabilistic algorithms in producing intricate and geometrical patterns and will deepen our understanding of how fractals model natural and mathematical phenomena.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
         We have learned throughout this semester that fractals are infinitely complex patterns that exhibit self-similarity at different scales. They appear in various natural and theoretical contexts, from the shapes of trees, plants, and lightning to the behavior of chaotic systems. Through this final, we will explore the mathematical generation of fractals through programming, using three core techniques. First, the Chaos Game illustrates how randomness and geometric constraints can produce order, specifically through the generation of the Sierpinski Triangle and Barnsley Fern. Second, L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems) model the recursive nature of plant growth and are used to draw fractal trees through string rewriting and turtle graphics. Finally, the Hilbert Curve demonstrates how a simple set of recursive rules can generate a continuous curve that fills space, offering insights into dimension and spatial efficiency. Through these three parts, this final will be able to piece together theory and computation, providing a visual and algorithmic exploration of fractal geometry.  
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        Fractal geometry was formalized in the 20th century by mathematicians such as Beno√Æt Mandelbrot, who introduced the concept to describe irregular and fragmented shapes in nature. Unlike traditional Euclidean geometry, fractals often have non-integer dimensions and are generated using recursive or iterative processes. The Chaos Game is a method that generates points based on probabilistic rules and consistently produces deterministic patterns, like the Sierpinski Triangle. Similarly, the Barnsley Fern uses affine transformations with assigned probabilities to simulate the growth of a fern-like plant. L-Systems were originally developed by Aristid Lindenmayer to model the growth of algae. They use symbolic rules to iteratively transform strings, which are then interpreted as drawing commands. These systems are especially suited for modeling branching structures like trees and plants. Hilbert Curves, on the other hand, are examples of space-filling curves. They are continuous fractal curves that pass through every point in a 2D grid without crossing themselves. Together, these methods represent diverse but interconnected approaches to understanding and constructing fractal structures through code.

        <h2>Methods / Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
         Part 1 of the final is called the Chaos Game. First we will generate the code that uses the Chaos game algorithm to generate the Sierpinski Triangle, which is a classic example of a fractal. The first part of the code is the setup, which defines three vertices of an equilateral triangle and initializes a large number of iterations. The x and y coordinates of the points are then stored in an array. The second part of this code randomly chooses an initial point within the triangle, and then we then enter the Chaos Game Loop. In the Chaos Game Loop, for each iteration, the algorithm randomly selects one of the triangle's vertices. It then finds the midpoint between that vertex and the last plotted point and this new midpoints becomes the next point to plot. This is then visualized as the code plots all points on a scatter plot. The result is the emergence of the Sierpinski Triangle, which we have studied before.

        <p>In the next part of Part 1, we will look at the code that generates the Barnsley Fern, another well-know fractal. We will do this using a method based on iterated function systems. This system works by transformation functions, as four affine transformations are defined and each function transforms a point (x,y) in a different way. These transformation model how different parts of a fern leaf are scaled, rotated, and translated. Each function has a probability associated with it, determining how often it's applied during the iteration process. Then starting from the origin, the code randomly selects a transformation function based on the given probabilities and applies it to generate a new point. This process is repeated 100,000 times, and each new point is stored. All generated points are plotted using a scatter plot and the final output is a realistic fractal image of a fern, showcasing self-similarity and natural complexity.    </p>

             <p> Part 2 of this final is called L-Systems. We will now look at the code that uses an L-System with turtal graphics to draw a fractal tree. It works by first initializing the turtle graphics environment. Then the L-System is generated and defined with an axiom ('F') and a rewrite rule. This rule recursively replaces every 'F' with a longer string over 4 iterations, generating a complex command string. The draw_lsystem function interprets the generated string using turtle commands. The turtle starts at a specified location and draws the structure using green color, step size, and angle. The final drawing is a recursive, self-similar tree structure that mimics the branching patterns of natural trees.    </p>

         <p>The third part of this final is called the Hilbert Curve. This code generates and draws a Hilbert Curve, a type of space-filling fractal, using an L-System and turtle graphics. This code works by first initializing the turtle graphics environemnt to enable line drawing on a canvas. The L-System is then generated- the Hilbert Curve is defined by the axiom 'L' and two rules. Over multiple iterations, the axiom string is expanded into a long command string that encodes the path of the Hilbert Curve. The draw_lsystem function interprets each character and then the step size is calculated so the entire curve fits in a 400- unit square. The turtle starts from a specific position and orientation to ensure proper placement on the canvas. The turtle draws a 5th- order Hilbert Curve, which intricately fills a square space without overlapping, demonstrating the curve's recursive and space-filling properties.  </p>

        <h2>Modifications</h2>
        <p>
         Now, let's do some modifications! For the first part of the section, we can make the Chaos Game (Sierpinski Triangle) visualization appear in 3D. We can do this by adding a third coordinate, and changing the plotting to 3D plotting. Let's look at the results!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://github.com/LindsGuinan/Labreports/blob/main/projection.png?raw=true" alt="Square Drawing" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy" />
          <figcaption>3D Chaos Game Sierpinski Projection </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> We can also modify the Barnsley Fern in part 1 by adding an animation of the fern growing. In this modification, you can see the projection of the fern growing and can also see a change in the color map! I also changed the number of iterations so you can see that the leaf is bigger and the dots are more compact in the animation.  </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://github.com/LindsGuinan/Labreports/blob/main/barnsley2.png?raw=true" alt="Square Drawing" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy" />
          <figcaption>Barnsley Growing Fern </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> Now we can make modifications the the L-Systems code in part 2. Let's change the order and see what the result is! The result is a coral looking plant. This is so fascinating because we can see that natural plants and living species like coral follow a natural fractal shape. </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://github.com/LindsGuinan/Labreports/blob/main/coral.png?raw=true" alt="Square Drawing" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy" />
          <figcaption>L-Systems Coral  </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p> Next, we can modify the Hilbert Curve by changing the jump position, color map, and the number of iterations. First lets look at the result of order 7. We can see that as the order increases, the curves in the shapes get smaller causing the shape to have more and more lines. </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://github.com/LindsGuinan/Labreports/blob/main/hilbert2.png?raw=true" alt="Square Drawing" width="600" height="400" loading="lazy" />
          <figcaption>Hilbert Curve of Order 7 </figcaption>
        </figure>
         <p>Lastly, we can look at the result of changing the order to 3. Now, we can see that the lines are more spaced and bigger. The shape looks more opened, and looks like a pacmac game! So, we can see through these modifications that the higher the number of iterations, the more compicated the shape is. </p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Hilbert Curve of Order 3 </figcaption>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This final project in fractal geometry explored the interplay between mathematics, recursion, and visual patterns through the implementation and modification of three major fractal systems: the Chaos Game, L-Systems, and the Hilbert Curve. Each part demonstrated how simple iterative rules can generate complex, self-similar structures. In Part 1, the Chaos Game revealed the surprising emergence of the Sierpinski Triangle and the Barnsley Fern from probabilistic transformations. Through experimentation with color gradients, transparency, and point density, we enhanced the visual clarity and aesthetics of these patterns while gaining insight into how randomness and affine transformations interplay in fractal formation. Part 2 introduced L-Systems, a rule-based approach that generated plant-like fractal trees. By varying the rules, angles, and iteration depth, we observed dramatic changes in structure and complexity. These modifications deepened our understanding of how symbolic string rewriting can model natural growth and recursion, as we saw a result similar to the look of coral in the ocean. Finally, in Part 3, the Hilbert Curve served as a compelling example of a space-filling curve. By increasing the iteration order we saw how such curves efficiently traverse space with continuity and self-similarity. Through coding, visualization, and creative modifications, this project reinforced key concepts in fractal geometry, including recursion, affine transformations, self-similarity, and space-filling behavior. The process also highlighted the value of iterative experimentation in uncovering deeper structural beauty within mathematical systems.
