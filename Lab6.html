    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
       This lab explores fractal geometry through iterative transformations applied to a two-dimensional grid of points. Using Python's Numpy and Matplotlib libraries, a uniform grid is generated and transformed by repeated applications of a complex quadratic function. The impact of varying the number of iterations on the complexity of the resulting fractal patterns is observed and analyzed. The results demonstrate that even simple transformations can produce intricate, self- similar structures characteristic of fractals. Modifications such are altering the transformation function and visual enchancements will be made to further explore this topic.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that emerge from the repetition of simple mathematical operations. Fractals are found both in nature and computer-generated graphics, and are characterized by self-similarity and detailed structure at every scale. In this lab, fractal geometry is investigated by applying iterative transformations to a two-dimensional grid of points in the complex plane. By transforming points with a simple quadratic function across multiple iterations, patterns resembling classic fractals emerge. Visualizations of the transformations at different stages will offer insight into the formation and evolution of fractal patterns. 
      <section id="background">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
         Fractal generation often relies on the concept of iteration, which is the process of applying the same mathematical operations repeatedly to a set of inputs. One well-known method involved complex numbers, where transformations are repeatedly applied to each point z in the complex plane. Depending on the choice of transformation and parameters, the resulting set can form intricate shapes. In this lab, a uniform 2D grid of points was first generated using NumPy's meshgrid function, creating evenly spaced points between -1 and 1 along both axes. The points were treated as complex numbers and iteratively transformed using the function. After each iteration, the real and imaginary parts of the resulting complex numbers were plotted using Matplotlib, revealing the evolution of the pattern. By adjusting the numbers of iterations, the complexity of the patterns increased, providing a visual demonstration of fractal behavior. 
        </p>

        <h2>Methods / Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
        First, we will look at the chunk of code that creates a uniform grid of points between -1 and 1 along the x- and y- axes, based on a specific grid size. The generate_grid functions then uses np.linspace to evenly space the points and np.meshgrid to form a 2D grid. The plot_grid function then visualizes the points by plotting them on a scatter plot. Finally, the grid is generated and displayed, showing a dense array of evenly spcaed blue points across the plane. 
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">!wget -O turtle_setup.py 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamedwardhahn/fractal25/refs/heads/main/turtle_setup.py'
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple 2D grid of points using NumPy
def generate_grid(size):
    x = np.linspace(-1, 1, size)  # Generate 'size' number of points between -1 and 1
    y = np.linspace(-1, 1, size)
    grid = np.meshgrid(x, y)  # Create a 2D grid of points
    return grid

# Visualize the grid of points
def plot_grid(grid):
    x_grid, y_grid = grid
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
    plt.scatter(x_grid, y_grid, s=1, color='blue')  # Plot the grid points
    plt.title(f'2D Grid of {len(x_grid)}x{len(y_grid)} points')
    plt.show()

# Set the size of the grid
size = 50  # You can adjust this to make the grid denser or sparser

# Generate and plot the grid
grid = generate_grid(size)
plot_grid(grid)
</code></pre>

        <p> Now we can apply an iterative complex transformation to a 2D grid of points and visualize the result. The iterative_transform function treats each point in the grid as a complex number z= x+iy. It then repeatedly applies the transformation for a specified number of iterations. After the transformations, the real and imaginary parts of the new z values are seperated to form a transformed grid. Finally, the transformed points are plotted using the plot_grid function, revealing how the grid distorts under the transformation.  </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
          
  def iterative_transform(grid, iterations):
    x_grid, y_grid = grid
    z = x_grid + 1j * y_grid  # Create a complex plane
    for i in range(iterations):
        z = z ** 2 - 0.5  # Iteratively apply the transformation
    return np.real(z), np.imag(z)

# Set the number of iterations
iterations = 1

# Apply the iterative transformation
fractal_grid = iterative_transform(grid, iterations)

# Plot the fractal grid
plot_grid(fractal_grid)

</code></pre>
             <p>Next, we can look at the code that applies the complex transformation twice to each point in the original 2D grid. This causes the points to distort further compared to a single iterations.  </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
# Set the number of iterations
iterations = 2

# Apply the iterative transformation
fractal_grid = iterative_transform(grid, iterations)

# Plot the fractal grid
plot_grid(fractal_grid)

</code></pre>
         <p>Lastly, we can look at the code that applies the transformation three times to each point in the 2D grid. This increases the distortion and complexity of the pattern.  </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
   # Set the number of iterations
iterations = 3

# Apply the iterative transformation
fractal_grid = iterative_transform(grid, iterations)

# Plot the fractal grid
plot_grid(fractal_grid)

</code></pre>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this lab, we explored fractal geometry and cellular automata through computational simulations. Our primary focus was on generating the Sierpinski Triangle, a well-known fractal, and experimenting with elementary cellular automata to observe how different rule sets influence pattern formation. We first implemented a recursive algorithm to generate the Sierpinski Triangle using the Turtle graphics library. By breaking down a large equilateral triangle into smaller self-similar triangles, we observed the fundamental property of fractals: self-similarity at different scales. Increasing the recursion depth allowed us to see finer details in the fractal structure. We then shifted to cellular automata, where we represented a simple one-dimensional system using a binary grid. The rules governing the automaton determined how each cell evolved based on its neighbors. By manipulating these rules we saw how different rule sets created vastly different patterns—ranging from highly structured, fractal-like formations to chaotic, random-looking structures. Some rules (like Rule 90) naturally formed fractal patterns, while others (like Rule 45) resulted in chaotic behavior, highlighting the connection between deterministic rules and emergent order. This lab illustrated how mathematical structures can emerge from simple, recursive rules. Fractals and cellular automata reveal how complexity can arise from simplicity, a concept that is widely applicable in science, technology, and nature. </p>
