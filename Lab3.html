    <p>
       This lab explores the concepts of fractals and cellular automata by implementing the Sierpinski triangle and simulating various cellular automaton rules. The Sierpinski triangle, a well-known fractal, is generated recursively using Turtle graphics, demonstrating the self-similarity and recursive nature of fractals. Additionally, the lab investigates the behavior of cellular automata, specifically focusing on Rule 90 and other rules like Rule 30, Rule 62, Rule 110, and Rule 126, applied to a 2D grid. The resulting patterns were visualized using NumPy and Matplotlib. Through this experiment, we observe the emergence of complex patterns from simple rules and gain insights into the fundamental principles of fractals and automata.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Fractal geometry studies shapes and patterns that exhibit self-similarity at different scales, meaning the structure of the whole is repeated in parts. One classic example of such self-similarity is the Sierpinski triangle, a fractal that can be constructed by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle into smaller equilateral triangles, removing the central triangle at each iteration. This process illustrates the concept of recursion, where a geometric shape is repeatedly divided into similar smaller parts. In addition to fractals, cellular automata (CA) are mathematical models that evolve based on local interaction rules. These systems are discrete in time and space, where each cell in a grid changes state based on the states of its neighboring cells. Cellular automata have applications in various fields, including physics, biology, and computer science, as they can model complex, emergent behaviors from simple local rules. In this lab, we utilize the Turtle graphics library to draw the Sierpinski triangle and apply cellular automaton rules, specifically Rule 90, which generates fractal-like patterns in a 1D grid. We also explore the behavior of several other cellular automaton rules, such as Rule 30, Rule 62, Rule 110, and Rule 126, and visualize the patterns they produce on a 2D grid using NumPy and Matplotlib.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
         Fractals are geometric shapes that are self-similar at various levels of magnification. This self-similarity means that smaller portions of the shape resemble the whole. The Sierpinski triangle is one of the most famous fractals, constructed through a recursive process. It begins with an equilateral triangle and recursively removes the central triangle from each resulting smaller triangle. This process, when repeated infinitely, results in a shape with intricate, repeating patterns that are similar at every scale. The Sierpinski triangle is a visual representation of recursive iteration, where each iteration follows a simple rule that generates a smaller version of the initial shape. In this lab, we use Turtle graphics, a Python module for drawing shapes, to visualize the process of generating the Sierpinski triangle. The recursive nature of the algorithm highlights the fundamental property of fractals: self-similarity. Cellular automata (CA) are mathematical models that simulate how a grid of cells evolves over discrete time steps based on local rules. Each cell can be in one of a finite number of states, and the state of each cell is updated based on the states of its neighbors. Cellular automata have been used to model a wide range of phenomena, from biological processes like the growth of plants to physical systems like fluid dynamics.

      <section id="methods">
        <h2>Methods / Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
         First, we will look at the code that tells the turtle to draw an equilateral triangle. 
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">!wget -O turtle_setup.py 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamedwardhahn/fractal25/refs/heads/main/turtle_setup.py'
import random

# Define the function to draw an equilateral triangle
def draw_triangle(length):
    for _ in range(3):
        forward(length)
        left(120)

</code></pre>

        <p> Now we can define a recursive function to draw a sierpinski triangle, which is a fractal pattern made up of smaller equilateral triangles. </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
   # Define the recursive Sierpinski triangle function
def sierpinski_triangle(length, order):
    if order == 0:
        draw_triangle(length)
    else:
        sierpinski_triangle(length / 2, order - 1)
        forward(length / 2)
        sierpinski_triangle(length / 2, order - 1)
        backward(length / 2)
        left(60)
        forward(length / 2)
        right(60)
        sierpinski_triangle(length / 2, order - 1)
        left(60)
        backward(length / 2)
        right(60)

</code></pre>
             <p> Now we will use the function we just made to draw the a sierpinski triangle fractal with an initial side length of 400 and of order 4. </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
   initializeTurtle()
showturtle()

# Set up the turtle
jump(300, 500)
face(90)
color('green')

# Draw the Sierpinski triangle
length = 400
order = 4
sierpinski_triangle(length, order)

show()

</code></pre>
         <p>Next, we will introduce the code for the cellular automata. In this chunk of code, we will import NumPy and Matplotlib and define a function plot(x) for visualizing a 2d array. We will then generate a 100x100 grid initialized with zeros. It will set the element at position (0,50) to 1, effectively placing a white pixel in the grid at that location while keeping all other pixels black. The plot(C) function then visualizes this grid as a grayscale image using matplotlib. After this, we have a code that takes an integer value 90 and converts it into an 8-bit binary representation using Python's string syntax. </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
      import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#visualizing a 2d array
def plot(x):
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow(x, cmap = 'gray')
    ax.axis('off')
    fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)
    plt.show()
#generate a 100x100 grid of zeros 
    C = np.zeros((100,100)).astype(int)
C[0,50] = 1
plot(C)
#converting integer number 90 into an 8- bit binary representation 
    num = 90
print(f'{num:08b}')

</code></pre>
         <p>Now, we can create and modify a 3D array called rule. This array represents a rule table for a cellular automaton, where each 3D index corresponds to a combination of neighboring cells and the rule specifies what the central cell should be based on its neighboring cells. This rule can be used in the cellular automaton algorithm to determine the next state of a grid based on the surrounding states.  </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
   rule = np.zeros((2,2,2))

rule[0,0,0] = 0
rule[0,0,1] = 1
rule[0,1,0] = 0
rule[0,1,1] = 1
rule[1,0,0] = 1
rule[1,0,1] = 0
rule[1,1,0] = 1
rule[1,1,1] = 0

</code></pre>
       <p> Using this new rule, we can now create a function that applies a 1D cellular automation rule (like rule 90, rule 30, etc.) to each row  based on the previous row's value. This is a common method used for generating patterns and fractals in cellular automata. The rule table defines how a new cell state is determined from its three upper neighborhoods. We can then generate and display a visual pattern based on the cellular automaton rule applied to the grid C, which was previously defined.    </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
    #Define the function 
    def CA(X):

    for i in range(1,X.shape[0]-1): #row
        for j in range(1,X.shape[1]-1): #col

            N  = X[i-1,j]
            NW = X[i-1,j-1]
            NE = X[i-1,j+1]

            X[i,j] = rule[NW,N,NE]

    return X
    #Create visual pattern
    plot(CA(C))
</code></pre>
        <p> Finally, we can create a chunck of code that applies the rule 90 to a 2D grid, uses the three upper neighbors to compute the next state of each cell, generates a fractal pattern called the sierpinski triangle, and displays the structure using plot. Lastly, we can run multiple cellular automaton simulations using different rules. This will generate and display a visualization of the evolving patterns for each rule and gives us insight on how different rules affect pattern formation in cellular automata, which reveals complex behaviors for simple rules.     </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
   #Function for generating fractal pattern       
   def CA(X):

    for i in range(1,X.shape[0]-1): #row
        for j in range(1,X.shape[1]-1): #col

            X[i,j] = (rule/(2**(4*X[i-1,j-1] + 2*X[i-1,j] + X[i-1,j+1]))) % 2

    return X

rule = 90

plot(CA(C))

#Rule for running multiple cellular automaton simulations using different rules
  for rule in [30, 62, 90, 110, 126]:
    plot(CA(C))
</code></pre>

        <h2>Results &amp; Analysis</h2>
        <p>In the first chunk of code, we define a function to draw an equilateral triangle. This function is then used to tell the turtle to draw an equilateral triangle. Let's look at the results!  </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In this lab, we explored the construction of various fractal and recursive patterns using Python's Turtle Graphics. Through the implementation of the Koch Curve, Dragon Curve, and random walk simulations, we gained insight on how recursion, randomness, and geometric transformations can create intricate and visually compelling designs. By modifying the base shapes and recursion depth, we observed how changes in the rules can significantly alter the complexity and appearance of the different fractals. We also learned that the higher the order, the more complex the fractal will be. We began by experimenting with basic line transformation, such as the Blip Line, which introduced the fundamental concept of breaking a segment into smaller recursive parts. Expanding on this, we generated the Koch Snowflake, learning how fractal growth can transform a simple triangle into a highly detailed shape. Further, we explored random walks, which demonstrated how randomness influences movement patterns and diffusion. Finally, we constructed the Dragon Curve which showed us how self- similar recursive structures can create complex, space- filling curves. This lab deepened our understanding of recursive functions and iterative geometric transformations, reinforcing key programming concepts such as function calls, loops, and conditional structures. Additionally, it demonstrated the power of recursion and randomness in generating mathematical art, bridging the gap between programming and visual creativity.
