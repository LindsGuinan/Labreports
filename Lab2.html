    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      In this lab, we will explore fractal geometry by utilizing recursive algorithms to generate two well-known fractals: the Dragon Curve and the Koch Snowflake. Fractals are shapes that look the same no matter how much you zoom in on them. Using Pythonâ€™s turtle graphics library, we will draw these fractals, which are made by repeating a simple rule over and over again. For the Dragon Curve, we will draw this through recursive splitting and turning and 90- degree angles repeatedly. We will create the Koch Snowflake by recursively subdividing an equilateral triangle, introducing smaller triangles at each iteration. These fractals will be drawn with increasing order of complexity, which will demonstrate how simple recursive rules and formulas can result in intricate patterns. Through this lab, we will observe the relationship between recursion and the detail of the fractal shapes in geometry. We will also gain an insight on the power of recursion in computer graphics and its application in generating fractals which displays great mathematical significance.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Fractals and randomness play an important role in many natural and computational systems. Fractals are patterns that repeat at different scales, meaning that no matter how much you zoom in, the shape remains similar to the whole. They can be found in nature such as in snowflakes, crystals, and lightning. We will also explore random walks whcih can be used to simulate unpredictable movement. Examples of this are the way gas particles move in a container, stock market prices, and the spread of heat in solids. In this lab, we will use Python's turtle graphics to explore both fractals and randomness. We will focus on The Koch Snowflake, The Dragon Curve, and Random Walks. The Koch Snowflake is a fractal that starts as a triangle and adds smaller triangles to each side in a repeating pattern. The Dragon Curve is a fractal that bends at 90-degree angles, forming a jagged, yet structured pattern. The Random Walks will simulate random movement in two dimensions, mimicking real-world unpredictable paths. By adjusting parameters such as recursion depth and step size, we can analyze how different fractals evolve and how randomness affects movement. This lab will help us understand how simple rules can create both structured complexity and chaotic behavior. 
      <section id="background">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Now, we will explore the background of fractals and recursive patterns. Fractals are geometric figures that exhibit self- similarity, meaning that smaller versions of the shape appear within the larger structure. They are commonly generated using recursion, where a function repeatedly calls itself with smaller input values. A random walk is a path made up of a sequence of random steps in different directions. This is commonly used to simulate Brownian motion, which describes how microscopic particles move unpredictably in a fluid. In this lab. we will implement a random walk where a virtual turtle moves forward in random directions at each step. Over time, this creates an unpredictable, yet structured path. Applications of fractals are widely used in computer graphics, scientific modeling, and natural simulations such as computer- generated landscapes (mountains and clouds), data compresssion (fractals can help reduce image file sizes), and future modeling (river formations, lightning patterns). Randsom walks are used in physics (modeling diffusion and particle motion), finance (prediciting stock market fluctuations), and biology (studying animal movement patterns). By coding and visualizing these processes and patters, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of how mathematical concepts shape the natural and digital world.

      <section id="methods">
        <h2>Methods / Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
         First, we will look at the code that simulates a random walk using Python's turtle graphics.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-python">!wget -O turtle_setup.py 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/williamedwardhahn/fractal25/refs/heads/main/turtle_setup.py'
import random

# Step 1: Initialize the turtle canvas
canvas_width = 1000
canvas_height = 800
initializeTurtle(initial_window_size=(canvas_width, canvas_height), mode='auto')

# Step 2: Function to perform a random walk (Brownian motion)
def random_walk(steps, step_length):
    speed(0)             # Set speed to maximum for faster drawing
    penup()
    jump(450, 450)       # Start near the middle of the canvas
    pendown()

    for _ in range(steps):
        forward(step_length)               # Move forward by the step length
        right(random.uniform(-180, 180))   # Turn by a random angle between -180 and 180 degrees

# Step 3: Execute the random walk with increased steps and/or step length
steps = 1000
step_length = 10

random_walk(steps, step_length)

# Step 4: Display the result
show()

</code></pre>

        <p>Now we will look at the code that will draw a straight line with a "blip" in the middle. </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
        initializeTurtle()
        showturtle()

        jump(50, 400)
        face(90)


        # Line with blip
        forward(800 / 3)
        left(60)
        forward(800 / 3)
        right(120)
        forward(800 / 3)
        left(60)
        forward(800 / 3)



show()
</code></pre>
        <p>We can use the blip line that we just made and create a recursive pattern of this blip line. The previous blip line was order 1, so it had one zigzag in the middle. This recursive blip line we will create has order 2, so each zigzag has smaller zigzags inside making it more detailed. We can see from this code that higher orders will create a fractal shape.  </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
      # Define the blip_line function
def blip_line(length, order):
    if order == 0:
        forward(length)
    else:
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)
        left(60)
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)
        right(120)
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)
        left(60)
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)


initializeTurtle()

# Draw blip lines of different orders
jump(50, 400)
face(90)
color('red')
blip_line(800, 1)  # Order 1

jump(50, 350)
face(90)
color('blue')
blip_line(800, 2)  # Order 2

show()
</code></pre>
             <p>Now we can use these tools to draw a Koch Snowflake, which is a very well-known fractal pattern that resembles a snowflake. This fractal is created using recursive line divisions and turns. We can use a recursive blip line function in which the recursion repeats for each segment, making the pattern more detailed at higher orders.  </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
     initializeTurtle()
showturtle()

# Define the blip_line function (Koch curve)
def blip_line(length, order):
    if order == 0:
        forward(length)
    else:
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)
        left(60)
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)
        right(120)
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)
        left(60)
        blip_line(length / 3, order - 1)

# Draw the Koch snowflake
def koch_snowflake(length, order):
    for _ in range(3):
        blip_line(length, order)
        right(120)

# Set up the turtle
jump(250, 500)
face(0)
color('blue')

# Draw the snowflake
length = 400
order = 3
koch_snowflake(length, order)

show()
</code></pre>
         <p>Now we will draw the Dragon Curve! At each recursion level of this function, the shape folds upon itself at a 90-degree angle.  </p>
        <pre><code class="language-python">
       # Define the dragon curve function
def dragon_curve(order, length, turn_direction):
    # Base case: if order is 0, just move forward
    if order == 0:
        forward(length)
    else:
        # Calculate the new length for each recursive step
        new_length = length / (2 ** 0.5)

        # Recursively draw the dragon curve, turning right and left as needed
        dragon_curve(order - 1, new_length, 1)  # First segment
        right(turn_direction * 90)             # Turn by 90 degrees
        dragon_curve(order - 1, new_length, -1) # Second segment

# Initialize the turtle for drawing
initializeTurtle()
showturtle()


# Move the turtle to a starting position
jump(400, 400)
face(0)             # Set starting direction
color('purple')     # Choose a color

# Draw the dragon curve
order = 10          # Complexity level
length = 300        # Initial length of each segment
dragon_curve(order, length, 1)

# Show the final drawing
show()

      <section id="results">
        <h2>Results &amp; Analysis</h2>
        <p>When we run the first code, the turtle starts at (450,450) and moves 1000 steps of 10 pixels each. After each step, it turns in a random direction. The resulting path is chaotic and unpredictable, similar to how tiny particals move in a fluid.   </p>

        </figure>
         </figure>
        <p> When we run the third code, we can see the results of a recursive blip line. As the function is called with a higher order, the pattern becomes more complex. We saw that the order 1 curve in the previous figure had one zigzag in the middle. This blip line is of order 2 and has smaller zigzags inside of each zigzag, making it more detailed. </p>

        </figure>
         <p> When we run the fourth chunk of code, we can see the results of a "blip line" of order 3 which draws a higher- order Koch Curve! </p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>Blip Line of Order 3/ Higher- Order Koch Curve </figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p> When we run the fifth chunk of code, we can see the result of the Koch Snowflake Fractal. In this function, at order 0 the shape is a simple triangle. At order 1 each side divides into four smaller segments with a peak in the middle. At order 2 the new segments also divide into four, making the pattern more complex. Lastly at otder 3 the shape resembles a snowflake, with highly detailed edges.  </p>

          <figcaption>Blip Line of Order 3/ Higher- Order Koch Curve </figcaption>
        </figure>
            <p> When we run the last chunk of code, we can see the result of drawing the Dragon Curve. This function creates a repreating folding process which is what gives the Dragon Curve its characteristic shape. At order 0: the structure is a straight line, at order 1: two segments form a right angle, at order 2: a more complex shape, with another right- angle fold, at order 3 and higher: the curve begins to form a unique, non- overlapping pattern, and finally at order 10 the final image is an intricate Dragon Curve.  </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          In this lab, we utilized Python's turtle graphics to generate a sequence of polyogns with increasing sides, ranging from triangles to 19-sided shapes. By implementing a structured approach, we initialized a canvas, defined helper functions for color randomization and polygon drawing, and positioned the polygons in a horizontal sequence. The use of random colors added visual variety, while the incremental increase in the number of sides demonstrated the geometric transformation from simple to complex shapes.

This exercise provided insights into computational geometry, the importance of precise angle calculations, and the versatility of turtle graphics for creative visualizations. Additionally, it reinforced programming concepts such as loops, functions, and coordinate positioning.
