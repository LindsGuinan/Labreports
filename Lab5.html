    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p> This lab will explore the construction and visualization of the Cantor set, a classic example of a fractal and a foundational object in mathematical analysis. Using a recursive Python function, the Cantor set it generated by repeatedly removing the middle third of a line segment at each level of recursion. The fractal will be plotted using matplotlib to illustrate its self-similarity and infinitely nested structure. This project highlights how simple recursive rules can create complex and counterintuitive geometric patterns.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Fractal geometry provides a framework for studying complex shapes that exhibit self-similarity across different scales. Unlike traditional Euclidean geometry, fractals often possess non- integer dimensions and arise naturally in various physcial, biological, and computational systems. One of the earliest and simplest examples of a fractal is the Cantor set, introduced by Georg Cantor in 1883. The Cantor set is formed by repeatedly removing the middle third of a line segment, producing an object that is uncontably infinite yet has zero total length. This lab shows the implementation of the Cantor set using recursive programming and visualization techniques in Python, emphasizing the conceptual beauty and mathematical richness of fractal structures. 
      <section id="background">
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
        The Cantor set is a fundamental object in fractal geometry and mathematical analysis. It is constructed through an iterative process: starting with a single line segment, the middle third is removed, and the process is repeated recursively for the remaining segments. Despite its simplicity, the Cantor set exhibits many remarkable properties: it is nowhere dense, uncountable, and has a Hausdorff dimension that is less than one, and it has log(2)/log(3) dimensions. The recursive nature of the Cantor set makes it particulary suited to algorithmic generation. In this lab, Python's recursive function calls are used to model this process, and matplotlib is utilized to create a visual representation. Understanding the Cantor set provides insights into concepts like measure theory, topology, and the foundations of modern fractal mathematics.  
      <section id="methods">
        <h2>Methods / Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
         Now, we will look at the code that recursively builds the Cantor set by starting with one full bar, or the intitial segment, an then at each level, the middle third of each existing bar is removed. Then the function draws the two remaining thirds, but lower down on the figure. This process is repeated 6 times and is finally plotted to visually show the fractal.

        <p>
         Now, let's do some modifications and see how incorporating: a wavy tilt that makes each level gently wave sideways, a color gradient that incorporates a smooth rainbow color from bright to dark, a modification in the bar thickness that makes the bars get thinner as you go deeper, and a level of transparency in which lower levels are fainter creating a misty layered effect.

          <p> Now, we can modify the Cantor set by randomly shifting the bars left and right as the image goes deeper, add random color, make the bars thin out with depth, and make the lines have no smoothness so the lines look natural. </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this lab, we explored fractal geometry by generating and modifying the Cantor Set using recursive programming techniques in Python. Starting with the classic construction, which was created by a repetitive removal of the third of a segment, we were able to visualize the basic structure by plotting bars that recursively split and descended in levels. Through various modifications, we were able to demonstrate how small changes to recursion parameters can create dramatically different fractal patterns. Introduing randomized tilts and color variations led to more chaotic, organic- looking fractals. Adjusting properties such as bar thickness, color gradients, and transparency enhanced the visual depth and artistic appeal of the patterns. Overall, this lab highlighted the sensitivity of fractal structures to initial conditions and transformations. Even minor alterations in recursive rules produced highly varies and complex outputs, demonstrating key properties of fractals: self- similarity, infinite complexity, and emergent beauty from simple rules. This lab reinforced the power of recursion not only as a mathematical tool but also as a creative method for generating rich and mathematically meaningful art.  </p>
