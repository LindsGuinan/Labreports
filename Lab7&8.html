       In this lab, we will explore fractal geometry through the exploration and visualization of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, two fundamental constructs in complex dynamics. By using Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Numba, we will generate high0 resolution visualizations of these fractals. The lab will involve zooming into intricate regions of the Mandelbrot set  and observing how different complex constants affect the structure of the Julia set. We will also explore enhancements using color maps and lay the foundation for future extensions like animation. These visual experiements reveal the complexity and self-similarity characteristic of fractals, reinforcing their mathematical beauty and computational richness.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
         Fractals are infinitely complex patterns that exhibit self-similarity across different scales. They are not only visually striking but also deeply connected to chaos theory, nonlinear dynamics, and complex analysis. In this lab, we focus on two prominent fractals: the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set. Both emerge from the iteration of simple complex functions and provide insight into the behavior of dynamical systems. Using Python and optimized numerical libraries, we implement algorithms to compute and visualize these sets. We will examine how changing the region of the complex plane (zooming) and modifying the iterative function's constant affects the output. Additionally, visualization techniques like varying colormaps are used to enhance interpretation and asethetics. The lab ultimately combines mathematical theory, computational methods, and visual analysis to explore the depth and beauty of fractals.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
         The Mandelbrot and Julia sets are based on iterating a simple complex function where z is a complex number representing a point on the complex plane and c is a constant complex parameter. In the Mandelbrot set, with fix z equal to zero and vary c. For each c, we track whether the sequence remains bounded or diverges. The Mandelbrot set is the collection of all such c values for which the sequence does not escape to infinity. Its boundary exhibits intricate, infinitely detailed structure, often explored through zooming. In contrast, the Julia set fixes the value of c and varies the initial z. This creates a complex and often fragmented image where each point's color reflects how quickly its orbit diverges. Depending on the choice of the c, the Julia set can be connected or completely dissconnected (dust). In this lab, we will use NumPy, Numba, and Matplotlib. Together, these will allow us to efficiently explore fractals in high detail, experiement with parameters, and appreciate their mathematical and visual complexity.

        <h2>Methods / Algorithm</h2>
        <p>
         First, we will look at the first chunk of code in Module 7. This code generates and visualizes the Mandelbrot Set, a famous fractal in complex dynamics. It uses numerical and plotting libraries and optimizes performance with Numba. The mandelbrot() function determines how many iterations a complex number c takes before the recursive formual defined escapes a radius of 2, up to a maximum number of iterations. The output value represents the "escape time" and is used for coloring. The mandelbrot_set() function generates a grid of complex numbers across a defined section of the complex plane and applies the mandelbrot() function to each point. The result is a 2D array of iteration counts, which forms the fractal image. Then we generate the fractal- the first call to mandelbrot_set() computes the full mandelbrot set and the second call zooms into a small region with more iterations for higher detail. Then the results are visualized. The 2D array is displayed using plt.imshow() with the "hot" colormap. A colorbar indicates escape times, and the plot is titled appropriately.

        <p> Now we can look at the code that generates a high- resolution zoomed-in view of a specific region of the Mandelbrot Set. This is done by zooming in on the defined region, the image resolution is set to high resolution for clarity and ensures finer details by allowing more iteration, and then the function is called with these parameters to compute the iteration counts across the zoomed region. The result is then plotted and the "hot" colormap gives a fiery gradient, enhancing contrast between the regions that escape quickly and those that remain bounded.   </p>

             <p> Lastly, we will move on to module 8. We will look at the code that generates and visualizes a Julia Set, which is a type of fractal derived from a fixed complex parameter c. Unlike the Mandelbrot set where c varies and z is fixed, the Julia set holds c constant and iterates over various initial z values. The function julia_set uses a compiled function to optimize performance. For each point z in a 2D grid on the complex plane, the function interatively applies the formula and counts how many iterations z takes to exceed a magnitude of 2. The function then outputs a 2D array where each value represents escape time, used to color the point. The Julia set is generated for a constant c value and the structure of this set depends heavily on this value- different values produce drastically different patterns.   </p>

   import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    for i in range(width):
        for j in range(height):
            z = r1[i] + 1j * r2[j]
            n = 0
            while abs(z) <= 2 and n < max_iter:
                z = z*z + c
                n += 1
            n3[i, j] = n

    return n3

# Parameters for the plot
xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax = -1.5, 1.5, -1.5, 1.5
width, height = 800, 800  # Image resolution
max_iter = 256  # Number of iterations for accuracy

# Choose a value for the complex constant c
c = complex(-0.8, 0.156)

# Generate the Julia Set
n3 = julia_set(c, xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, width, height, max_iter)

         Now, we can first modify the Mandelbrot Set. I modified the color map, the zoom-in points, the number of iterations, and the resolution of the image to result in the  below image. This result is so cool beacuse it looks like lightning, which is a natural fractal!

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this lab, we explored the mathematical and computational foundations of fractal geometry through the generation and visualization of fractal geometry through the generation and visualization of the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. By implementing optimized algorithms using Python and Numba, we were able to efficiently compute high- resolution fractals over complex planes. These visualizations revealed the self- similar and infinitely detailed nature of fractals, particulary along the boundaries of the Mandelbrot set. We then conducted experiments by modifying key parameters such as zoom levels, iteration depth, constant values, and color map. This allowed us to observe how increasing resolution and focusing on smaller regions unveiled new, intricate structures- reinforcing the concept of infinite complexity in fractals. Additionally, we explored the sensitivity of the Julia set to the complex constant c, demonstrating how small changes in this value drastically affect the overall structure and connectivity of the fractal. We say that these modifications to these sets produced natural looking fractals that we would see in everyday life, such as lightning. This lab reinforced key concepts in fractal geometry and complex dynamics, while also emphasizing the power of computational tools in visualizing and understanding mathematical phenomena that are otherwise difficult to grasp through analytical means alone.   </p>
